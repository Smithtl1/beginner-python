###For Variables:

* Assign your varaible in your def
* For example def function.py (a):  `a` is your variable.
* They are used so that you can put many different inputs into code so that you can test different outputs. A variable is a storage location paired with an identifier, that has a value.
* The different types of variables are `arrays`, `boolean`, and `integer`.

###For Conditionals

* Conditionals are used to say that `if` something happens, `then` something will return. 
* Conditionals are used by `if`, `then`, `else`, and `elif` operations
* For example, look at the condition below:
```
	def function(a, b):
		if a > b:
			return a
		else: 
			return b
```
* If the value of a is greater than the value of b, it will return the amount that a has.  If a is smaller, it will return the integer for b. 
* Conditionals are a bunch of `true/false` statements that work its way down a tree to get to a soluion.
